<p>CommuniKate is heavily documented, you can read all about its design and use in our <a href="https://github.com/joereddington/CommuniKate/blob/master/CommuniKateManualLaunch.docx?raw=true">80page manual</a>, and play with our online demos of both <a href="http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v1/ck20/en/">CK20</a> and <a href="http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v2/ck12/en/">CK12</a> before you download.</p>

<p>The demos are fully interactive online versions of the page set. There is a <a href="http://communikate.joereddington.com/releases/v1/ck20/por/">Portuguese version</a> of the CK20 demo, and we have volunteers currently translating for a range of languages. If you are interested in helping us translate the page set to any other language weâ€™d love to hear from you.</p>
